RAG SYSTEM - COMPLETE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

Congratulations! You've built a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a modern React chat interface.

SYSTEM FEATURES:
==============
- Domain-focused question answering (pre-loaded with historical data)
- Real-time chat interface similar to ChatGPT/Gemini
- Source citations for all answers
- RESTful API backend
- Responsive web design
- Docker containerization support

HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM:
=====================

OPTION 1: Quick Start (Windows)
-------------------------------
Double-click on "run_full_system.bat" to automatically:
1. Install all Python dependencies
2. Install all frontend dependencies
3. Start the backend API server
4. Start the React frontend
5. Open your browser to the chat interface

OPTION 2: Quick Start (Mac/Linux)
---------------------------------
1. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x run_full_system.sh

2. Run the script:
   ./run_full_system.sh

OPTION 3: Manual Setup
----------------------
1. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   cd src/rag_system/frontend
   npm install

3. Initialize with sample data (from root directory):
   cd ../../..
   python init_rag.py

4. Start the backend API:
   cd src/rag_system/api
   python main.py

5. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
   cd src/rag_system/frontend
   npm run start

6. Access the chat interface at:
   http://localhost:3000

OPTION 4: Docker Deployment
---------------------------
docker-compose up --build

Access at: http://localhost:8000

ACCESSING THE CHAT INTERFACE:
============================
After starting the system, open your browser and go to:
- http://localhost:3000 (if running frontend separately)
- http://localhost:8000 (if using Docker or combined setup)

Try these example questions:
- "Who led the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 and why was it important?"
- "What was the purpose of the Salt March?"
- "When did India gain independence?"

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=================
Backend: Python 3.10+ with FastAPI
Frontend: React 18 with Vite
ML Models: sentence-transformers, Hugging Face Transformers
Vector DB: FAISS
API Port: 8000
Frontend Port: 3000
